My name is Neil. Welcome to my site.

 I'm a security professional, programmer, devops guru, sensi, professor, and IRONMAN.  I'm also a husband, father, and grand-father.  I have spent more than 20 years in industry, working with and for companies of all shapes and sizes.  I started in infrastructure and in the early days of "cloud" became fascinated with being able to build complex infrastructures using code.  From that point forward I've focused my efforts on building security into infrastructure leveraging the same principles as we follow for software development.  

 I build test driven infrastructure on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> using
